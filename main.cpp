/*
This is essentially memehax's luaC re-written ish
in a way
this was rewritten by ElKoax and will most likely be open sourced,
id just like to say i tried to write this neat as fuck.

and i also plan on adding there parser, which is pretty cool.

Credits

Eternal (for his retcheck)
ringarang for his splitstring thingy magig
im not sure who the sigscanner is but (credits to the person who made it dunno who did)
and also tepig for giving me a base to start from (memehax's luaC) i just liked the way of the OP_GETGLOBAL etc.
